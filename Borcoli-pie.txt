cut and squeeze the rinsed brocoli and sort it in one layer over the breadcrubs layer in the baking tray.
mix the maynaze, the eggs, the baking pouder and salt and pepper very well in a bowl to create a smooth paste.
apply it over the brocoli in the baking tray and make sure it is properly covered, although some brocoli may pop out (it doesnt have to be higher than the brocoli). spread the sateed onoins as a toping to the pie.
put in the oven for ~20 minutes until the pie is golden top and bottom.

bon appetite! :)
